# 🔧 General Design Rules
The background color should always be #121212 (dark).
The primary accent color should be #3ECF8E.
All text should be white (#FFFFFF) for readability and contrast.

# 🎨 Styling
Use TailwindCSS for all styling.
Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary.
Ensure sufficient padding, spacing, and contrast in all UI components.
Prioritize visual hierarchy — headers should stand out clearly.

# 📐 Layout & Structure
Use full screen sections when applicable.
Make components responsive and mobile-friendly.

# 🧠 Code Quality
If a file exceeds 600 lines of code, refactor it by extracting reusable components.
Prioritize readability and maintainability over cleverness.
Use meaningful names for components, functions, and variables.
Avoid deeply nested JSX — break into smaller components as needed.

# 📁 File Structure
Place all React components in `/components`.
Pages should be in `/app`
Use PascalCase for component filenames and camelCase for variables/functions.

# 💡 Best Practices
Use functional components with hooks.
Use async/await instead of .then().
Use TypeScript and include type annotations where possible.
Prefer client-side caching where appropriate, and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

# 📊 Analytics & SEO
Ensure pages follow basic SEO structure (title, meta tags).
Maintain accessibility standards (aria-labels, keyboard nav, etc.).
